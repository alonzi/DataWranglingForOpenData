# 2.1.3 Data Error Prevention, Enhancement, and Preparation for Distribution - Pete Alonzi October 22, 2018
## 2.1.3.1 Error Prevention
### 2.1.3.1.1 Valid Values (Enumeration)
* column I (semesters_worked): need to choose between words or numbers
  * for example row 31-33 are words not numbers so they are invalid (but do contain info we like)
  * sometimes the way to fix is to do it by hand - **sort the dataset on column I, discuss how to fix**
* [Enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration)
  * The term is commonly used in mathematics and computer science to refer to a listing of all of the elements of a set. The precise requirements for an enumeration (for example, whether the set must be finite, or whether the list is allowed to contain repetitions) depend on the discipline of study and the context of a given problem.
  
### 2.1.3.1.2 Range Checking
* classic example is Nuclear Ghandi in the video game Civilization
  * https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nuclear-gandhi
  * Ghandi starts the game as super peaceful, but if you do something to placate him he becomes super aggressive
  * He start with aggression = 0, so when you give him -1 it becomes 7, because it was 1-bit in the programming
* practice with column H - badge #
  * in this case we can just make an artificial constraint say we only want badges below 250,000
  * create a new column using a function IF(H2<250000,"VALID","INVALID")
  
### 2.1.3.1.3 Duplicate Records
* IF(COUNTIF($A$2:$A$<<lastrow>>, $A2)>1, "Duplicate", "Unique")

## 2.1.3.2 Enhancing Your Data
### 2.1.3.2.1 Splitting/Joining Columns
* Data --> Text to Columnns  (then play around with clicky interface)
### 2.1.3.2.2 Joining Tables (not the database definition)
* using content from one sheet in another sheet
* it is important to not duplicate data because then you need to update it in multiple places
* excel syntax: "=Sheet1!C11"
* breakdown: = << name of sheet >> ! << cell id in original sheet >>
* clicking with mouse fills it in automatically

### 2.1.3.2.3 Pivot Tables
* A pivot table is a table of statistics that summarize the data of a more extensive table (such as from a database, spreadsheet, or business intelligence program). This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together in a meaningful way. ~ [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table)
* select the wage column, click insert, click pivot table (interface may vary based on version)

## 2.1.3.3 Preparation for Distribution
### 2.1.3.3.1 Identify Fields for Distribution
* What do I want to convey?
* What does my audience need to understand it?
* What am I allowed to share with my audience?

### 2.1.3.3.2 Suitable Names
* short and pithy
* clear and unambiguous
* follow convention: Upper Case, Lower Case, Proper Case, Camel Case, or Snake Case

### 2.1.3.3.3 Unicode - Special Characters
* text must be encoded so that a computer can store the information and then represent it when loaded
* the current standard is utf-8
* if you need to use a special character (eg: รถ) it is best to use the utf-8 version (&#246;)

### 2.1.3.3.4 Remove Blank Lines
### 2.1.3.3.5 Data Dictionary
* There's an old saying and it goes like this
  * Q: If you have an excel file of 100 MB how much data do you have?
  * A: 0 MB
  * Q: If you have a well formatted relational database of 100 MB how much data do you have?
  * A: 0 MB
  * Q: If you have a good data dictionary how much data do you have?
  * A: More than you could ever handle.
  
* The point is that without a data dictionary your dataset has no meaning.

* Key features:
  * clear definitions of fields in your dataset
  * references to specs where appropriate
  * recipie to validate contents of dataset
