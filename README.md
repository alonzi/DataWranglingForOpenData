* Teach basic data cleaning principles

## Concepts
* Wrangling happens after you collect the data but *before* you share or analyze the data. Two rules of thumb:
  1. If you haven't wrangled the data you don't share the data. *You still share the raw data
  2. If you haven't wrangled the data your analysis is meaningless.

## Open Questions
1. R, Python, etc. ?
2. Can I put the open dataset on github?
